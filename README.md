# Motivation

It is a Medium.com clone work in progress. The motivation behind this small app is to demonstrate something functional built with React without lot of fancy dependencies, so it is easier for the beginners who know javascript to get started with. The only major dependencies it has apart from React is [reach router](https://reach.tech/router) and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). I am not using fancy state management solutions like Redux or MobX because React's own state management is good enough for an app of this scale. I am also not using immutable data structures, thinking that it would be a premature performance optimization and would complicate things for my audience.
